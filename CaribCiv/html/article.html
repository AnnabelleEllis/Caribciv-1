                            <p>Globalization, also defined as the increased interconnectedness and interdependence of
                                peoples and countries, is generally understood to include two inter-related elements:
                                the opening of international borders to increasingly fast flows of goods, services,
                                finance, people and ideas; and the changes in institutions and policies at national and
                                international levels that facilitate or promote such flows. (WHO) World health
                                organization</p>

                            <p>Regional integration is the process by which two or more nation-states agree to
                                co-operate and work closely together to achieve peace, stability and wealth. Usually
                                integration involves one or more written agreements that describe the areas of
                                cooperation in detail, as well as some coordinating bodies representing the countries
                                involved. This co-operation usually begins with economic integration and as it
                                continues, comes to include political integration. Regional Integration in the Caribbean
                                is mainly through the Caribbean Community, or CARICOM. In addition, member states in the
                                sub-region are members of the Organization of the Eastern Caribbean States (OECS).</p>
                            <p>The global village is described as the world viewed as a community in which distance and
                                isolation have been dramatically reduced by electronic media (such as television and the
                                Internet)</p>
                            <p>The Caribbean is a region that has been invaded by European countries which lead to an
                                ill-management of resources. This subsequently had negative impacts on Caribbean
                                development because the assets in the Caribbean region were not utilized properly.
                                Caribbean economies became distorted and success was geared towards the elite instead of
                                the Caribbean peoples. Thus, there was economic growth but negative development among he
                                Caribbean peoples. As stated best by Coleman and Nixson, “it is possible to have
                                economic growth with negative development in that, although average incomes may have
                                risen , the economic lot of the mass of the population would have deteriorated and
                                negative or no progress would have been made in transforming personal attitudes and
                                institutions in the manner required by modernization ideals”. This has led to
                                inequalities in income distribution and unequal access to education, primary health
                                care, financial credit and technology. This kind of development is a dependent rather
                                than an autonomous one. </p>
                            <p>In dependent development, there is unwanted large scale interference in the
                                political, social and economic aspect of a country. In relation to the Caribbean,
                                the transnational co-corporations (TNC’s) such as Nestle, Colgate Palmolive, Johnson
                                and Johnson etc. came to enhance their profitability. These companies provide little
                                to no meaningful economic activity in the region as they are involved either through
                                a parent or subsidiary company. However, autonomous development is where there is
                                freedom from unwanted interference, the freedom of trade, the accumulation and
                                utilization of domestic savings, and strong indigenous management. Cuba is great
                                example of autonomous development. However, there are some step backs in
                                implementing this kind of development, Cuba has felt the repercussions of this. They
                                have faced being isolated from trade and being denied access to lending institutions
                                such as the IMF and the World Bank. This is what the region fears if this decision
                                is chosen. This is so because the region does not have the necessary local capital
                                to fund the kind of development yearned for in the Caribbean. </p>
                            <p>Countries taking loans from the financial institutions such as the IMF has no
                                bargaining power in the structural adjustments if they would like to secure the loan
                                desired. Thus these countries find that they have no control over their economic
                                affairs since the IMF determines the national economic priorities and goals. The IMF
                                policies usually involve severe regimen of financial cuts in government expenditure,
                                an end to subsidies on a wide range of basic foods for the poor and stringent
                                taxation. IMF demands a laying off of a large number of public servants and a policy
                                of wage restraint for both public and private sector, a severe reduction in welfare
                                programmes, including unemployment maternity and sickness benefits etc. An example
                                of this can be seen with Dominican Republic, Jamaica and Guyana. These countries
                                have found it hard to make short term structural adjustments and have experienced
                                severe struggles to achieve economic growth. As a result of this the Caribbean has
                                been dependent on the developed countries. It has been a never ending cycle of being
                                slave to countries that have much more power. </p>
                            <p>The Caribbean has also been attacked with the issue of globalization through
                                technology where more geographical borders disintegrate and the Caribbean culture is
                                being erased and replaced by other cultures in different spheres of the world. Thus,
                                the Caribbean is being bombarded with the effects of globalization with no means of
                                escaping.</p>
                            <p>In order to combat this issue of the Caribbean buried in effects of globalization,
                                the region has developed CARICOM, CDB and many more. CARICOM was established under
                                the treaty of Chaguaramas in 1973. Though notcreated for political purposes CARICOM
                                has the opportunity to create political
                                union between member states. Political integration has its advantages however itruns
                                the risk of political federation under the guise of CARICOM. WithinCARICOM there are
                                sub unions working towards the goal of integration such asCaribbean Single Market
                                and Economy and the Caribbean Court of Justice.Previously well established unions
                                such as the Free Trade Area of the Americas(FTAA) and the European Union (EU) serves
                                as evidence that Caribbeanintegration is a step in the right direction towards the
                                development of the region.CSME gives a major boost to the economy where it creates a
                                larger market forbuyers and sellers of the region and money circulating within the
                                region certainly
                                attributes to development. The CSME is more than just a common a market, itsspeaks
                                to a unified economy which can attract foreign investors and also giveregional
                                entrepreneurs an international market. There exists unions that are against
                                integration however it can be seen where bigger strides can be made towards
                                thedevelopment of the region when the islands are in unity.
